function meshStruct=TrussMesh;
% meshStruct=TRUSSMESH
% This file defines the geometry for the TRUSS2D3D code. User must input the
% nodal coordinates and the connectivity array.
% The portions of the code that might change for each new problem are
% clearly indicated. The output from this function is meshStruct which has
% all of the mesh information, as detailed in the help documentation for
% Truss2D.
