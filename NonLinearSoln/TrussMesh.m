function meshStruct=TrussMesh
% meshStruct=TRUSSMESH
% This file defines the geometry for the TRUSS2D3D code. User must input the
% nodal coordinates and the connectivity array.
% The portions of the code that might change for each new problem are
% clearly indicated. The output from this function is meshStruct which has
% all of the mesh information, as detailed in the help documentation for
% Truss2D.

% some information about the types of elements
nnpe=2;   % number of nodes per element. define this variable since it will 
          % be used for determining the dimensions of future arrays.
        
% Define the coordinates of the nodes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% DEFINE THIS FOR EACH PROBLEM
% If you give an x and y coordinate, this is a 2D problem. If you give 3
% coordinates for each node, this is a 3D problem.
% first column is x coordinates of each node, second column is 
% y coordinates of each node, and third column (if present) is z 
% coordinates of each node
% nCoords=[0 0; 1 0];
nCoords=[0 0; 1 0; 0 1];
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% number of nodal points in the mesh. Does not have to be entered manually.
numNodes=size(nCoords,1); 
% define this variable to be able to change code easily for 2D or 3D problems.
numDim=size(nCoords,2); 
numDOF=numDim; % number of degrees of freedom per node. 

% Define the connectivity array (dimensions are numEls X nnpe)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% DEFINE THIS FOR EACH PROBLEM
% elCon(i,j) is the global node number of the jth node of the ith element
% elCon=[1 2];
elCon=[1 2; 3 2];
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

numEls=size(elCon,1); % number of elements in the mesh.
                      % does not have to be entered manually.

% Use the connectivity array to define gatherMat which shows the global
% degrees of freedom for each local degree of freedom.
gatherMat=zeros(numEls,(nnpe*numDOF));
for n=1:nnpe  % loop over the number of nodes per element
    globalNodes=elCon(:,n); % global node number for this local node
    for d=1:numDOF % loop over the number of degrees of freedom per node
        % use global node numbers to find global DOFs
        % corresponding to the local DOFs.
        gatherMat(:,(n-1)*numDOF+d)=(globalNodes-1)*numDOF+d;
    end
